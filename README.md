my Bachelor's thesis project in computer scienceâ€”a web-based Laboratory Substance Management System called "LabStock". Designed to streamline the often complex and critical task of managing substances within a laboratory environment, this system offers a user-friendly interface for doctors. Features include inventory tracking, expiration date notifications, usage history logs, and a robust search functionality.
